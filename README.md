# RockPaperScissors
Made a Rock Paper Scissors game that keeps track of user and computer match wins.
Put the game in a loop so the program can run multiple games
  - Each match is tracked and is incremented with every game played
Also using c++11 libraries to implement better rng than the regular stand() and rand()
used <chrono> & <thread> to add delay to the console output
